Course Enrollment System
The Course Enrollment System is a Java-based console application designed to help students enroll 
in and manage their courses efficiently. It provides a simple and organized way to input course information, 
select course types, and store enrolled courses while preventing errors through proper input handling. The 
system solves the problem of manually tracking subjects by offering a structured interface that displays all 
enrolled courses in a readable format. Its design highlights fundamental OOP concepts, making it not only 
functional but also an educational example of object-oriented programming in Java.
